# WE DID CODING

Jack from the future, if you're reading this, these are the projects from the TechNL course we did. I hope you read this next summer because that is when we'll do this again (hopefully).

So far, we did a calculator, a guessing game, and we designed something in canva (It's not great, however, it's like a 6/10)
